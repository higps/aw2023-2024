  Priority:
  1. Fix so spawn sounds don't trigger unless the player is alove, as now they play when selected when dead
  2. Using Item loadout preset binds now counts as a death, resetting your paid robot to an unpaid robot.

Bugs:
Paid menu sometimes lets you reslect robot

Become a HUuman Robot:
1. Use a paid robot
2. Have the menu open
3. Volunteer and select the robot

Paid Robot Bug:
- Paid menu sometimes doesn't close or white out the selected robot, allowing you to turn back to human

If you mash boss menu button you revert back to human

Sometimes a player who is a robot, but disconnects gets autobalanced to the other team

Somteimes, selecting a robot doesn't close the menu, and allows you to select the same robot again (happens with paid robots)


unify sounds
 OnMapStart precaches
extract robot_factory / robot_assembly
  unify 
   setting attributes etc.
storage:
 - turn target into targetlist in storage plugin? ... maybe? 
   needed in command too so it would be duplicate code
     unless command gets setup in main-plugin too?

codestyles
 .editorconfig
